# Comparing Suicide Rates by Age Groupings in Argentina, Finland, and the United States in the Time Period of 1985 to 2015

## Section 1 Introduction 

The following statistical analysis was done to examine differences in suicide rates among different age 
groups (e.g. 15-24 years of age) and among three different countries: Argentina, Finland, and the United 
States. Because suicide rates can be used as one measure of a societies well-being, comparing suicide 
rates among different countries can help one understand the causes of a societies emotional distress. 
For example, if one country has a higher suicide rate than another, it is an indication that there are 
factors in the former country that are contributing to emotional distress for the population. These 
factors could include economic hardships, a culture that values individualism rather than collectivism, 
etc. Examining suicide rates through the lens of age-groupings is also important because knowing which 
age-groups are most effected can help a society determine which interventions would be most helpful 
to address the problem. For example, if it is found that the people in the age group of 75+ have the 
highest rates of suicide, a prioritized intervention could be to address chronic loneliness among the 
elderly. 

The data for the following analysis was obtained from kaggle.com and contains data compiled from four 
different datasets. The full list of datasets is given in the references section at the end of this report 
under the heading “Original Dataset Retrieved From:” The data was edited by Szamil on kaggle.com and
it was this edited dataset that was used for the following analysis. Although the original dataset 
contained many treatment factors, only two were used in this analysis, and the data for both factors was 
originally obtained from the World health Organization’s data on worldwide suicide rates. 

As has been alluded to, the response variable used for this analysis was suicide rate, measured as the 
number of suicides per 100,000 people. One treatment factor used was the country in which the data 
was collected with three levels: Argentina, Finland, and the United States. The other treatment factor 
was the age group of each person/observation in the study, with six levels: 0-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-
34, 35-54, 55-74, 75+. The experimental unit and observational unit were the same in this study, 
namely, an individual person. 

There were 1092 observations in the dataset for 18 treatment combination. This means there is was 
about 61 observations per treatment combination, and that the principle of replication was satisfied. 
The exact methods of data collection are unknown, however, because the data was originally from the 
World Health Organization – a reputable organization as far as data collection is concerned – it was 
taken for granted that proper methods were used to make the observations randomized. 

No blocking factors were accounted for in the following analysis. The covariates involved in this study 
are plentiful but ignored in this analysis. Examples of covariates include: the overall physical health of 
the population and the difference in living standards among the countries. Another covariate is the time 
in which the observations were collected. The observations were collected from the time-period 1985 to 
2015.
